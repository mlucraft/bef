<h2 class="title">About Us</h2>

<div id="aboutusframes">
<h3>Who are we?</h3>
<p>My husband and I met as students at Edinburgh University and have always loved the city. We moved back to Scotland 2 years ago and now run a small property rental and development business.</p>
<p>We now live on a sheep farm north of Edinburgh with our young family but regularly visit the city to enjoy all it has to offer.</p>
<p>We enjoy finding flats in Edinburgh that we know to be in excellent locations and which we enjoy staying in ourselves. </p>
<p>We buy good quality furniture and fittings that we enjoy using and looking at ourselves and insist upon very high standards of cleanliness from the firm of professional cleaners we employ.</p>
<p>We started renting to holiday makers in April 09 and have had extremely positive feedback about how lovely our flats are to stay in.</p>
</div>

<div id="aboutusframes">
<h3>Why did you buy your properties?</h3>

<div id="leftcol">
<p class="red"><strong>59 The Park</strong></p>
<p>We felt that The Park is an ideal tourist flat. It is on the doorstep of all the major tourist attractions - Holyrood Palace, Parliament, Royal Mile, Castle, Grassmarket are all 1-5 mins walk from the front door.</p>
<p>Despite it being in the heart of all the action You get a really good night's sleep in this flat due to it's situation within a small private development and facing onto Holyrood Park.</p>
<p>The area is packed full of bars, restaurants, shops etc.  You don't need to walk far for anything. </p>
<p>We have a dog and young children ad being on the doorstep of Holyrood Park is brilliant for giving them all a big run around first thing in the morning.</p>
</div>

<div id="rightcol">
<p class="red"><strong>Drummond Place</strong></p>
<p>We have always aspired to own a beautiful Georgian flat in the best part of Edinburgh's the New Town.</p>
<p>We bought this flat in July 2008 and in conjunction with Historic Scotland and a local architect, have carried out a complete renovation, restoring many original features and a sense of grandeur to what was a tired old rental property.  The renovation was completed in August 2009 and lettings started in September.</p>
<p>We love the vibrancy of the location - it is just a few minutes walk to George Street, Princes St and St Andrew's Square and all the major Art Galleries and Theatres.  In spite of the central location it is a very peaceful flat as it looks on to Drummond Place Gardens.</p>

<h3>What benefits do you enjoy whilst staying in the properties?</h3>

<div id="leftcol">
<p class="red"><strong>59 The Park</strong></p>
<p>We like the fact that it is so easy to stay here.  Allocated parking, lift access and quick to warm up in the winter. It is a really cosy place which is a real bonus given Scotland's weather reputation.</p>
<p>We adore being in Edinburgh during festival time and love the fact that this flat is in the heart of the action. After a long day's festivalling and coming out of a show in the early hours of the morning you can be in bed within a few minutes. Perfect!</p>
</div>

<div id="rightcol">
<p class="red"><strong>Drummond Place</strong></p>
<p>Broughton Street is a minute's walk from the flat and is crammed full of lovely restaurants, cafes and bars which are open throughout the day.</p>
<p>The best feature of our flat has to be the large open plan area. To achieve this we knocked a wall down and now have 3 large sash windows that let in the morning sun and give wonderful views across the gardens and the New Town.  This is great space to socialise and relax. The bedrooms are all to the back and top of the flat which means they pick up all the afternoon sun and are far removed from any street noi se. Enjoy!</p>
