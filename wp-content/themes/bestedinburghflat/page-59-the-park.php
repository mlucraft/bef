<h3>Why stay here?</h3>
<div id="leftcol">
<p><span class="red"><strong>Brand new everything!</strong></span> - Holyrood Park Place has only just come onto the letting market.  In April 2009 it was newly decorated and furnished to a very high standard.   When the apartment is not receiving guests it is our home from home so we have ensured it is a place we find as inviting and comfortable as we hope you will.</p>
<p><span class="red"><strong>Parking</strong></span> - very few hotels and self catering accommodation in central Edinburgh are able to provide parking so if you're driving to the City, rest assured that you'll have a secure underground car park with 24 hour surveillance in which to keep your car.</p>
</div>

<div id="rightcol">
<p><span class="red"><strong>Concierge service</strong></span> - residents of The Park employ a small team who are on duty 24 hour a day to look after the development, greet visitors, answer questions and generally be helpful.</p>
<p><span class="red"><strong>Lift access</strong></span> - Edinburgh is a city of many ups and downs. So if at the end of a long day walking around the city you are not keen to tackle the steep climbs of some of the older Georgian and Victorian flats in Edinburgh then Holyrood Park Place is the place for you.</p>
