<p><strong>Welcome to Drummond Place</strong></p>
<p>Drummond Place is one of the most desirable New Town addresses.  All flats are A-listed and protected by Historic Scotland regulations.

<p>In our renovation of this flat we have tried to preserve the grandeur of the Georgian era whilst incorporating the convenience of modern living but with the overall aim of comfort, warm and luxury.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>
